# A/B Testing and Regression Analysis

This repository contains Python code for conducting A/B testing and regression analysis on experimental data. A/B testing is a statistical method used to compare two or more groups to determine if there are statistically significant differences between them. Regression analysis, on the other hand, is a statistical technique for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

## Overview

In this project, we utilize Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, Statsmodels, and Matplotlib to perform A/B testing and regression analysis on example data. The goal is to demonstrate how to analyze experimental data, compare group means, and model relationships between variables.

## Contents

- `A_B_Testing_Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for conducting A/B testing and regression analysis.
- 
## Installation

To run the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Asfand5214/A_B_Testing_Analysis.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd A_B_Testing_Analysis
   ```
4. Open and run the `A_B_Testing_Analysis.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

## Usage

The notebook provides step-by-step instructions on how to:

- Generate example data for A/B testing.
- Conduct a t-test to compare means of two groups.
- Visualize the data using histograms.
- Fit a linear regression model to the experimental data.
- Interpret the results of the regression analysis.
- Visualize the regression line and scatter plot of the data.
